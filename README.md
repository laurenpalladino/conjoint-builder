# conjoint-builder

This code can be used to build vignette-style conjoint experiments in Qualtrics. I use JavaScript to set up attribute levels, build a randomize function, and establish exclusion restrictions. HTML is used to edit the final appearence in the Qualtrics platform. The same js can be used to program table and vignette style conjoints with minimal editing in the HTML. conjoint.js is an example that is used in a current working paper, a more adaptable js template will be uploaded soon :) For questions and usage please email lauren.palladino@stonybrook.edu
